![Echonest] (http://the.echonest.com/static/img/logos/250x80_lt.gif)

**echonesst-ruby-api** is a pure Ruby wrapper around the Echonest APIs. 

## Requirements
* An API Key (available free)
* Ruby 1.9.3+
* [echonest/echoprint-codegen](https://github.com/echonest/echoprint-codegen) binary in your `$PATH` if you want to identify audio files. (yeah, *identify!*)

## Installation

In your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'echonest-ruby-api'
```
    
and then `bundle install`

Or install locally:

    $ (sudo) gem install echonest-ruby-api


## Usage

Require the gem in your file:

```ruby
require 'echonest-ruby-api'
```

## Artist

Create an instance of an object

```ruby
artist = Echonest::Artist.new('YOUR-API-KEY', 'Weezer')
```

Then you have access to a bunch of methods:

```ruby
    artist.name
    artist.biographies
    artist.blogs
    artist.familiarity
    artist.hotttnesss
    artist.images
    artist.songs
    artist.profile
```

Artist methods support requesting buckets according to [documentation](http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4/artist.html). Buckets are added as array to request object:

```ruby
    artist.buckets = %w[artist_location biographies blogs years_active id:7digital-US id:spotify-WW id:musicbrainz]
```
    
*Exact response are specified in the RDoc, but the method names try to be as self-explanatory as possible.*

## Song

Create an instance of the Song module.

```ruby
song = Echonest::Song.new('YOUR-API-KEY')
```

Then you have access to the song/search endpoint:
*(this is where it gets clever)*

```ruby
params = { mood: "sad^.5", results: 10, min_tempo: 130, max_tempo: 150 }
song.search(params)
```

See the full list of params [here](http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4/song.html#search)

## Identification

> **Note:** This stuff is flakey as hell. Seems to work pretty well on OSX, but it doesn't work out of the box. You'll need to follow these instructions to get it working.

You can even **identify** a song simply from its fingerprint! Support for this is flaky so far and only tested on OS X.

Firstly, make sure that the `echoprint-codegen` binary is available on your local `$PATH`. 
    
Just run: `echoprint-codegen` on the terminal and see if it returns anything other than an error.
    
If it's not installed, you'll need to compile it from source. **It's not as scary as it sounds.**


    brew install ffmpeg boost taglib # Install dependencies
    
    cd ~/Desktop/ # or somewhere else sensible, you can delete it later anyway
    
    git clone https://github.com/echonest/echoprint-codegen.git
    
    cd echoprint-codegen
    
    make
    
    make install
    
This should then allow you to use the `echoprint-codegen` command at the command line. If not, try following the instructions here: [echonest/echoprint-codegen](https://github.com/echonest/echoprint-codegen)

Then just use this method call:

```ruby
song = Echonest::Song.new('YOUR-API-KEY')
code = song.echoprint_code('path/to/audio/file')
puts song.identify(code)
```

If there's a positive match, it'll return something like this:

```ruby
{
  "response": {
        "status": {
        "code": 0,
        "message": "Success",
        "version": "4.2"
      },
      "songs": [
      {
        "title": "Billie Jean",
        "artist_name": "Michael Jackson",
        "artist_id": "ARXPPEY1187FB51DF4",
        "score": 49,
        "message": "OK (match type 5)",
        "id": "SOKHYNL12A8C142FC7"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Checkout `spec/song_spec.rb` for an example code to test it out. 

Note that this calls the song/identify API endpoint and does *not* support other Echoprint servers.

## Testing

Testing is done using RSpec. Just run `guard` in the root directory and it'll run the tests automatically. Use `vcr` to mock responses from the Echonest servers.
