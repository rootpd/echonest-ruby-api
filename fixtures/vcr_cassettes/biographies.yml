        American alternative rock band. Formed in 1992, they have released eight full
        length albums, six EPs, and a DVD. Their latest album, Hurley, was released
        on September 14th, 2010. They have sold over 9 million records in the United
        States to date.   Weezer formed in Los Angeles, California by Rivers Cuomo,
        Patrick Wilson, Matt Sharp, and Jason Cropper, who was later replaced by Brian
        Bell. Five weeks after forming, they had their first gig, opening for Dogstar
        at Raji''s Bar and Ribshack on Hollywood Boulevard. Weezer began playing clubs
        to small audiences around L.A. and recording home-demos. Soon the band began
        to receive attention from various A&R reps, and were signed on June 26, 1993
        by Todd Sullivan, an A&R rep from Geffen Records. The band was signed onto
        the DGC label (which later became Interscope).  Creating \"The Blue Album\"
        (1993-1994)  The self-titled debut, Weezer, commonly referred to as The Blue
        Album, was released May 10, 1994. \"Undone - The Sweater Song\", \"Buddy Holly\"
        and \"Say It Ain''t So\" were released as singles. The album was produced
        by former The Cars frontman Ric Ocasek. During the recording of the Blue Album,
        Jason Cropper left the band to take care of his future wife, who was pregnant
        with their first child. Jason was replaced by Brian Bell, a then bassist from
        a band called Carnival Art.  \"Undone - The Sweater Song\" was released as
        the first single. Spike Jonze directed the music video for the track. In a
        single unbroken take, it featured Weezer performing the song on a sound stage
        with various amusing studio antics, including a pack of dogs swarming the
        set.  Jonze also later directed the band''s second video, \"Buddy Holly\".
        The video featured footage of the television sitcom Happy Days spliced with
        the band performing in a remade \"Arnold''s Diner\", a setting from the series.
        The video had heavy rotation on MTV, and went on to win Jonze and the band
        four MTV Video Music Awards, including Breakthrough Video and Best Alternative
        Music Video, and two Billboard Music Video Awards. This video was also included
        as a bonus on the Microsoft Windows 95 CD. The success of the video arguably
        pushed the band into the mainstream spotlight.  The video for Weezer''s third
        single, \"Say It Ain''t So,\" was directed by Sophie Muller. It featured the
        bandmates playing hacky sack and performing in the band''s original rehearsal
        space in California. A photo of what the band calls the \"Garage\" is featured
        on the inside cover of the album.  The Blue Album is currently certified 3
        times platinum, making it Weezer''s all-time best seller. It was re-released
        and repackaged in 2004 as a Deluxe Edition, which included a second disc of
        b-sides along with other previously unreleased rarities.  Killer Record: Pinkerton(1995-1997)  In
        late December 1994, Weezer took a break from touring for the Christmas holidays.
        Cuomo traveled back east to his home state of Connecticut, and using an eight-track
        recorder, he began piecing together demo material for Weezer''s next album.
        Cuomo''s original concept for Weezer''s sophomore effort was to be a space-themed
        rock opera, Songs from the Black Hole.  The album was intended to feature
        songs that flowed together seamlessly, and ended with a special coda that
        briefly revisited the major musical elements of the piece. The band began
        demoing and working on Cuomo''s concept through intermittent recording sessions
        in the spring and summer of 1995. Ultimately, the Songs from the Black Hole
        album concept was dropped. The album would instead feature some old tunes
        from before their first album (which had briefly been incorporated into the
        space-opera) as well as some new ones written while Cuomo was at Harvard.  After
        the multi-platinum success of their debut album, Weezer''s sophomore album
        was finally released on September 24, 1996. Pinkerton, which peaked at #19
        in the U.S. upon its release, didn''t sell as many copies as its predecessor,
        probably due to its darker, more abrasive nature. Pinkerton was labeled \"one
        of the worst albums of 1996\" by a Rolling Stone reader poll. Eventually,
        the album grew into a cult classic, and is viewed by some as Weezer''s greatest
        album. In fact, in 2004, the magazine changed their rating to a 5-star rating
        and inducted it into The Rolling Stone Hall Of Fame. This article can be found
        in the Reviews sections of the 500 Greatest Songs Of All Time issue.  Three
        singles were taken from the album: \"El Scorcho\", \"The Good Life\" and \"Pink
        Triangle\". The video for \"El Scorcho\" featured the band inside a darkened
        room, sitting in a circle, that would be lit differently throughout parts
        of the song; it was directed by Mark Romanek. The video for \"The Good Life\"
        was directed by the team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (though no known
        video was made for \"Pink Triangle\"). However, the singles did not receive
        as much airtime as the singles from their debut album.  The title of the album
        comes from the character Lieutenant Pinkerton in Giacomo Puccini''s opera
        Madame Butterfly. The entire album is heavily influenced by the opera''s story
        line. Madame Butterfly is mentioned under her real name, Cio-Cio San, in \"El
        Scorcho.\" The song \"Butterfly\" is written from Pinkerton''s point of view
        at the end of the opera.  The album''s title was the source of a legal challenge.
        Pinkerton Securities of Encino, Calif., filed a temporary restraining order
        against the band and its Geffen record label for copyright infringement two
        days before the album was to be released on September 24, 1996. A judge ruled
        against the security company and the album was finally released.  Weezer completed
        their touring for Pinkerton in the summer of 1997. The members of the band
        took a break, with drummer Patrick Wilson returning to his home in Portland,
        Oregon to work on his side project, The Special Goodness, Matt Sharp left
        to complete the follow-up album for his group The Rentals, and Brian Bell
        went to work on his group, Space Twins.  Rivers Cuomo returned to Boston,
        Massachusetts, but dropped out of Harvard to focus on songwriting. He eventually
        went into seclusion. He painted his walls black, disconnected his phone, and
        didn''t communicate with anyone. Later, he formed a solo group, The Rivers
        Cuomo Band. Cuomo used the group to try out unreleased material, including
        possible new songs for the next Weezer album. The band played their first
        show at T.T. the Bear''s on October 8, 1997. Future Weezer bassist Mikey Welsh
        was part of the solo band''s lineup. The Boston songs were later abandoned
        and not used on the next Weezer album, but live recordings of the Boston shows
        are openly traded on the internet. In February of 1998, Rivers left Boston
        and Harvard academia behind and returned to Los Angeles.  Pat Wilson and Brian
        Bell joined Cuomo in L.A. to start work on the next album. Matt Sharp did
        not rejoin the band and officially left the group in April of 1998. The group
        decided on Mikey Welsh as Sharp''s replacement. Weezer continued rehearsal
        and cut demos until the fall of 1998. Frustration and creative disagreements
        led to a decline in rehearsals, and in late fall of 1998, drummer Pat Wilson
        left for his home in Portland pending renewed productivity from Cuomo.  The
        band would not reunite until April of 2000, when the Fuji Festival in Japan
        offered Weezer a high-paying gig to play in August 2000. The festival served
        as a catalyst for Weezer''s productivity, and from April to May, 2000, the
        band rehearsed and demoed new songs in Los Angeles. The band returned to live
        shows in June 2000, but without the Weezer name. Instead the shows featured
        the group''s first use of the pseudonym Goat Punishment.  On June 23, 2000,
        the band, now back under the Weezer name, joined the Warped Tour for eight
        planned dates. Weezer was received well at the festival, leading the band
        to book more tour dates for the summer.  SS2K - The Summer Sessions (2000)  In
        the summer of 2000, Weezer (now consisting of Rivers Cuomo, Mikey Welsh, Pat
        Wilson, and Brian Bell) went on tour. Weezer''s setlist consisted of 14 new
        songs that fans have labeled the Summer Songs of 2000 (commonly abbreviated,
        SS2K). When 13 of these songs did not appear on Weezer''s next album, fans
        of the songs started a petition demanding the release of studio demos. Eventually,
        mp3s were made available on the band''s official website for download. Three
        SS2K songs, \"Hash Pipe\", \"Dope Nose\" and \"Slob,\" have appeared on studio
        albums (\"Hash Pipe\" on the Green Album and \"Dope Nose\" and \"Slob\" appearing
        on Maladroit).  Green Album & Maladroit (2001-2003)  Eventually, the band
        went back into the studio to produce a third album. Weezer (2001) chose to
        repeat the self-titled name of their first release. This album quickly became
        known as The Green Album due to its distinctive bright green coloring. Shortly
        after the release of The Green Album, Weezer went on another American tour.
        They attracted a new generation of fans thanks to heavy MTV rotation for the
        videos of their hit singles \"Hash Pipe\" and \"Island in the Sun.\"  The
        video for \"Hash Pipe,\" directed by Marcos Siega featured sumo wrestlers
        and was nominated for Best Rock Video at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards,
        but lost out to Limp Bizkit''s \"Rollin.\" Two videos were recorded for \"Island
        in the Sun.\" Marcos Siega directed the first, which focused on a Mexican
        wedding, and Spike Jonze directed the second, which involved Weezer with animals
        in a wildlife reserve. Their video for \"Photograph\" was shot and put together
        by Weezer friend and unofficial \"5th member\" Karl Koch.  As reported on
        August 16th, 2001, by MTV, bassist Mikey Welsh was checked into a psychiatric
        hospital. His whereabouts were previously unknown, as he mysteriously went
        missing before their second filming of the \"Island in the Sun\" music video,
        featuring the band with various animals. Weezer was prompted to find a temporary
        replacement for Welsh. Through a mutual friend, Cuomo received Scott Shriner''s
        number and asked if he was interested to fill in for Welsh. Shriner, at first
        believing it was a prank phone call, accepted.  Much to the ire of their recording
        label, Weezer decided to forgo the industry-preferred waiting period of 2
        to 3 years between albums and began recording demos for their fourth album.
        The band took an experimental approach for the recording process by allowing
        fans to download the demos from their official website in return for feedback.
        After the release of the album, the band subsequently stated that the process
        was somewhat of a failure, as the fans did not supply them with cohesive constructive
        advice. Only the song \"Slob\" was included on the album due to general fan
        advice.  The fourth album, Maladroit, was released in 2002 with Scott Shriner
        replacing Mikey Welsh on the bass. The album served as a harder-edged version
        of their trademark catchy pop-influenced music. Although met with generally
        positive critical reviews (including making many \"Best of ''02\" lists),
        its sales were not as strong as The Green Album and remains their worst-selling
        album to date.  Two singles were released from the album. The \"Dope Nose\"
        music video featured a Japanese motorcycle gang, and was put into regular
        rotation. The music video for \"Keep Fishin''\" combined Weezer with The Muppets,
        and had heavy rotation on MTV. Both videos were directed by Marcos Siega.  As
        soon as Maladroit had wrapped up, the band immediately began work on their
        fifth album, recording numerous demos between tours for Maladroit (often recording
        as many as 24 songs in a day). These songs were eventually scrapped, and Weezer
        took a break after the release of two albums in quick succession.  Make Believe
        (2003-2005)  In March of 2004, Weezer released their first DVD. Titled Video
        Capture Device, the DVD contains all of their then-current music videos. It
        also included live concerts and homemade movies. The DVD was certified \"gold\"
        on November 8, 2004.  From December 2003 to the summer and early fall of 2004,
        the members of Weezer recorded a large amount of material intended for a new
        album to be released in the spring of 2005 with producer Rick Rubin. The band''s
        early recording efforts became available to the public through the band''s
        website. The demos, entitled the Album Five Demos (or album 4.5), were a big
        hit with fans but only one song, \"Hold Me\", would be included on the finished
        album. That album, entitled Make Believe, was released on May 10, 2005. The
        album was very well received by the public. However, long-time Weezer fans
        often consider it as a decline from their earlier albums, and has received
        mixed reviews.  The album''s first single, \"Beverly Hills,\" became a hit
        in the U.S. and worldwide, staying on the charts for several months after
        its release. The video for \"Beverly Hills\", directed by Marcos Siega, featured
        the band and a select choice of fans interacting with Playboy Bunnies and
        Hugh Hefner at the Playboy Mansion. It became the first Weezer song to hit
        #1 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. The song was nominated for Best Rock
        Song at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, the first ever Grammy nomination for
        the band. The video for the song was also nominated for Best Rock Video at
        the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards.  During the \"Make Believe\" tour of 2005,
        Cuomo allowed other members of the band to step into the spotlight of certain
        songs:      * Brian Bell: \"Getchoo\" and \"Why Bother?\" (from Pinkerton),
        \"Smile\" (from \"The Green Album\"), and \"Keep Fishin''\" (from Maladroit)     *
        Scott Shriner: \"Fall Together\", and \"Dope Nose\", and \"In the Garage\"
        (from \"The Blue Album\")     * Patrick Wilson: \"Photograph\" (from \"The
        Green Album\"), \"Song 2\" (Blur cover, whilst playing lead guitar)  In late
        August 2005, Weezer performed with the rock band The Pixies, which was one
        of Rivers'' influences, at Summerfest and other dates.  From September 8 to
        October 28, 2005, Weezer set out on a tour with the Foo Fighters, which, to
        many, was simply called Foozer. The Foozer tour was awarded \"Most Creative
        Tour Package\" at The 17th Annual Concert Industry Awards.  On December 13th,
        2005, Winter Weezerland EP was released on iTunes. The EP was essentially
        a re-release of the 2000 Weezer christmas CD which featured \"The Christmas
        Song\" and \"Christmas Celebration\".  Also, in late 2005 the band released
        the second single off Make Believe, called \"We Are All on Drugs\" (for family-oriented
        purposes, some releases of the song were renamed \"We Are All in Love\"),
        and the music video was directed by Justin Francis. It didn''t do well as
        a single, and many weezer fans hated it.  In early 2006, it was announced
        that Make Believe was certified platinum, and \"Beverly Hills\" was the second
        most popular download on iTunes for 2005.  Also in early 2006, Make Believe''s
        third single, \"Perfect Situation\", spent four weeks in a row at the #1 spot
        on the Billboard Modern Rock chart, a personal record for Weezer. The Perfect
        Situation video starred Elisha Cuthbert and was directed by Marc Webb. The
        only other Weezer track to hit #1 was \"Beverly Hills,\" for one week. \"This
        is Such a Pity\" is the band''s fourth single from the album, but no music
        video was made for its release.  The Future (2006-)  As of January, 2006,
        Bell and Wilson are set to portray Velvet Underground members Lou Reed and
        John Cale in Factory Girl, an upcoming film about the life of Andy Warhol
        cohort Edie Sedgwick.  Rivers Cuomo announced a new song called \"Piece of
        the Pie\" while onstage during the band''s October 7th, 2005 show in Detroit
        (but did not perform it). Cuomo has mentioned other song ideas recently, dropping
        titles and ideas such as \"East Coast or West Coast,\" \"Pig\" and new songs
        with lyrics he described as \"bloggy\".  Rivers has commented on his myspace
        blog that his recent comments to mtv.com were ''misquoted'' and said that
        what he meant \"was that the soccer song, \"Our Time will Come\", certainly
        won''t be on a Weezer album.\" and said \"The rest of the songs, though, are
        definite contenders for a Weezer record.\" A strong hint that the band are
        in fact only on a break and that a sixth album is on the card.  In late 2006,
        Brian Bell began work on a new project called The Relationship which fans
        can follow on the band''s myspace page. Pat Wilson told Keifer Wells and Martin
        Michalek in a radio interview for Andover High School that he and Scott Shriner
        had been creating songs together and are trying to get Rivers to sing for
        when the band has jam sessions. Pat has also been creating a few Special Goodness
        songs, but said little more on the subject. Fans can currently follow the
        news of the band at Rivers Cuomo''s myspace page and the official Weezer website.  Weezer''s
        sixth studio album will be released on June 3, 2008, just over three years
        after their latest release, Make Believe. Rick Rubin produced the album[30]
        and Rich Costey provided the mixing[31] for what Weezer fans are calling \"Album
        Six\".[32] The record is being described as \"experimental\", and according
        to Cuomo, includes longer and non-traditional songs, TR-808 drum machines,
        synthesizers, Southern rap, baroque counterpoint, and band members other than
        Cuomo writing, singing, and switching instruments.[33]  Lead singer Rivers
        Cuomo released a demo-compilation album entitled Alone: The Home Recordings
        of Rivers Cuomo on December 18, 2007. The album contains demos of Cuomo''s
        that span from 1992 to 2007, including songs from Weezer''s abandoned second
        album, Songs from the Black Hole. Also included in Alone is a song intended
        for Weezer''s upcoming 6th studio album, entitled \"This is the Way\". The
        booklet of Alone tells of the band wanting the song for the album, but ultimately
        choosing \"an epic, 6-minute, symphonic type of art song\" entitled \"Daydreamer\"
        instead.  Weezer''s \"Weezer\" (also referred to as \"The Red Album\") was
        released in June 2008. Rick Rubin produced the album and Rich Costey mixed
        it. The record is being described as \"experimental\", and according to Cuomo,
        includes longer and non-traditional songs, TR-808 drum machines, synthesizers,
        Southern rap, baroque counterpoint, and band members other than Cuomo writing,
        singing, and switching instruments. Pat Wilson said that the album cost about
        a million dollars to make, contrasting it with the $150,000 budget of \"The
        Blue Album\". The album''s singles were produced by Jacknife Lee. Its lead
        single, \"Pork and Beans\", topped the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks charts
        for 11 weeks, and its music video won a Grammy for Best Short Form Music Video.
        The album''s second single, \"Troublemaker\", debuted at #39 on the Billboard
        Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart and peaked at #2. In October 2008, the group
        announced that the third single would be \"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived
        (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)\".  In 2009, the band announced their next album,
        \"Raditude\", would be released on November 3, 2009, where it debuted as the
        seventh best-selling album of the week on the Billboard 200 chart. The band
        scheduled tour dates in December 2009 extending into early 2010 to coincide
        with the new album''s release. On December 6, 2009, Weezer frontman Rivers
        Cuomo was injured when his tour bus crashed in upstate New York due to black
        ice. Cuomo suffered three broken ribs, and his assistant broke two ribs. His
        wife, baby daughter, and their nanny were also on the bus; however, they escaped
        injury. Weezer cancelled tour dates the following day. The band resumed touring
        on January 20, 2010.  In December 2009, it was revealed that the band was
        no longer with Geffen Records. The band stated that they would still release
        new material, but they are unsure of the means, whether it be self-released,
        released online, or getting signed by another label. Eventually, the band
        was signed to the independent label Epitaph.  The album \"Hurley\" was released
        in September 2010 through Epitaph Records. The name comes from the character
        Hugo \"Hurley\" Reyes from the television show \"Lost\". Jorge Garcia, the
        actor who portrayed Hurley, stated that being featured on the album cover
        is \"one of the biggest honors of [his] career.\" Weezer used internet streaming
        service YouTube as a way to promote the album. Weezer loaned itself to 15
        amateur online video producers, \"going along with whatever plans the creator
        could execute in about 30 minutes.\" They have used many of the popular channels
        to promote themselves, such as Barely Political, Ray William Johnson and Fred
        Figglehorn. The Gregory Brothers solicited musical and vocal contributions
        from the band on one of its compositions built around speeches by Rep. Charles
        Rangel and President Barack Obama. Weezer calls the promotion \"The YouTube
        Invasion\"  On November 2, 2010, Weezer released another studio album called
        \"Death to False Metal\". This album was composed of newly re-recorded versions
        of unused recordings spanning the band''s career.  On October 9, 2011, the
        band announced on their website that former bassist Mikey Welsh had died.  The
        band currently consists of the following members:      * Brian Bell -- guitar,
        backing vocals     * Rivers Cuomo -- vocals, guitar     * Scott Shriner --
        bass guitar, backing vocals (2002-present) (plays on Maladroit and Make Believe)     *
        Patrick Wilson -- drums  Former members:      * Jason Cropper -- Guitar, left
        the band in September 1993 (believed to have been fired by Cuomo, although
        it is not clear as Cropper is forbidden from discussing the issue)     * Matt
        Sharp -- bass guitar, backing vocals (1992-1997) (plays on The Blue Album
        and Pinkerton)     * Mikey Welsh -- bass guitar, backing vocals (1998-2001)

        and debut album (1992-1995)edit:\n\nMain article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weezer_(1994_album)\nWeezer,
        consisting of Rivers Cuomo, Patrick Wilson, Matt Sharp, and Jason Cropper,
        formed in 1992, had their first practice on February 14 of that year, and
        their first gig was opening for Keanu Reeves'' band Dogstar shortly thereafter.
        Weezer signed with Geffen Records on June 25, 1993 and recorded their debut
        album with producer Ric Ocasek at Electric Lady Studios in New York City.
        During the recording, guitarist Jason Cropper left the band and was replaced
        by Brian Bell. The band released Weezer (also referred to as \"The Blue Album\")
        in May 1994. The record label originally did not wish to release a single,
        to see what sales could be generated by word-of-mouth alone. Soon after the
        release of Weezer, DJ Marco Collins of the Seattle radio station The End started
        playing \"Undone - The Sweater Song\", leading Geffen to release it as the
        first single. The music video was directed by Spike Jonze. Filmed in an unbroken
        take, it featured Weezer performing on a sound stage with little action, bar
        a pack of dogs swarming the set. The video became an instant hit on MTV. \nJonze
        also directed the band''s second video, \"Buddy Holly\". The video featured
        footage from the television sitcom Happy Days spliced with the band performing
        in a remade \"Arnold''s Drive-In.\" The video achieved heavy rotation on MTV
        and went on to win Jonze and the band four MTV Video Music Awards, including
        Breakthrough Video and Best Alternative Music Video, and two Billboard Music
        Video Awards. The clip was also featured on the companion CD for the Microsoft
        Windows 95 computer operating system. A third single, \"Say It Ain''t So\",
        followed. Weezer is certified triple platinum in the United States, making
        it Weezer''s all-time best seller. It is certified double platinum in Canada.
        \n\nPinkerton (1996-1997)edit:\n\nMain article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinkerton_(album)\nIn
        late December 1994, Weezer took a break from touring for the Christmas holidays.
        Cuomo traveled back east to his home state of Connecticut, and using an eight-track
        recorder, he began piecing together demo material for Weezer''s next album.
        The original concept for Weezer''s second album was to be a space-themed rock
        opera, Songs from the Black Hole. The album was intended to feature songs
        that flowed together seamlessly and end with a special coda that briefly revisited
        the major musical elements of the piece. The band began demoing and working
        on Cuomo''s concept through intermittent recording sessions in the spring
        and summer of 1995. Ultimately, the Songs from the Black Hole album concept
        was dropped. The album would instead feature songs composed before the band''s
        first album (which had briefly been incorporated into the space opera) as
        well as some new ones written while Cuomo was at Harvard. \nWeezer''s second
        album, Pinkerton, was released on September 24, 1996. Three singles were taken
        from the album: \"El Scorcho\", \"The Good Life\", and \"Pink Triangle\".
        The album''s title sparked a legal challenge. Pinkerton Securities of Encino,
        Calif., filed a temporary injunction against the band and its Geffen record
        label for trademark infringement two days before the album was to be released
        on September 24, 1996. A judge ruled for Weezer, and the album was finally
        released. This injunction caused Geffen to hold back some of the initial advertising
        and promotion for the album, possibly contributing to the album''s slow initial
        sales. Due to initial weak sales (it peaked at No. 19 in the U.S.), the album
        was, at first, viewed as a commercial failure, especially when viewed in light
        of the multi-platinum success of their debut album. The album failed to gain
        traction in the mainstream music world, perhaps due to its darker, more abrasive
        sound.Pinkerton was labeled \"one of the worst albums of 1996\" by a Rolling
        Stone reader poll. However, word of mouth kept the trickle of sales going
        and eventually the record achieved cult status. In the book The ''90s (2010),
        Rolling Stone ranked Pinkerton number 48 in the 100 Best Albums of the Nineties.
        \n\nOn hiatus (1997-2000)edit:\n\nWeezer completed their touring for Pinkerton
        in the summer of 1997. The members of the band took a break, with drummer
        Patrick Wilson returning to his home in Portland, Oregon to work on his side
        project, The Special Goodness; Matt Sharp left to complete the follow-up album
        for his group The Rentals; and Brian Bell went to work on his group, Space
        Twins. \nRivers Cuomo returned to Boston, Massachusetts, but took a break
        from Harvard to focus on songwriting. Cuomo gathered Boston-area musicians
        and rehearsed new material, including possible songs for the next Weezer album.
        The group, referred to by fans as the Rivers Cuomo Band, had several different
        lineups and played several shows at local clubs, including their first show
        at T.T. the Bear''s on October 8, 1997. Future Weezer bassist Mikey Welsh
        was a constant of the group''s evolving lineups. Pat Wilson eventually flew
        to Boston to sit in on drums. The Boston songs were later abandoned and not
        used on the next Weezer album, but live recordings of the Boston shows are
        openly traded on the internet. In February 1998, Rivers left Boston and returned
        to Los Angeles. \nPat Wilson and Brian Bell joined Cuomo in Los Angeles to
        start work on the next album. Rumours suggest Matt Sharp did not rejoin the
        band and left the group in April 1998, something Sharp denies. The group decided
        on Mikey Welsh as Sharp''s replacement. Weezer continued rehearsing and cut
        demos until the fall of 1998. Frustration and creative disagreements led to
        a decline in rehearsals, and in late fall of 1998, drummer Pat Wilson left
        for his home in Portland pending renewed productivity from Cuomo. In November
        1998, the band (with a substitute drummer) played two club shows in California
        under the name Goat Punishment. The shows consisted entirely of Nirvana and
        Oasis cover songs, respectively. In the months following, Rivers Cuomo went
        into a period of admitted depression, painting the walls of his home black
        and putting \"fiberglass insulation all over the windows and then black sheets
        of fiberglass so that no light could get through. \nThe band would not reunite
        until April 2000, when the Fuji Rock Festival in Japan offered Weezer a high-paying
        gig to play in August 2000. The festival served as a catalyst for Weezer''s
        productivity, and from April to May 2000, the band rehearsed and demoed new
        songs in Los Angeles. The band returned to live shows in June 2000, playing
        small unpromoted concerts under the pseudonym Goat Punishment. In June 2000,
        the band joined the Warped Tour for nine dates. \n\nRenewed popularity and
        The Green Album (2000-2001)edit:\n\nMain article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weezer_(2001_album)\nIn
        the summer of 2000, Weezer (now consisting of Rivers Cuomo, Mikey Welsh, Pat
        Wilson, and Brian Bell) went on tour (including dates on the popular Vans
        Warped Tour). Weezer''s set-list consisted of 14 new songs that fans have
        labeled the Summer Songs of 2000 (commonly abbreviated, SS2K). When 13 of
        these songs did not appear on Weezer''s next album, fans of the songs started
        a petition demanding the release of studio versions. \nEventually, the band
        went back into the studio to produce a third album. They chose the title,
        Weezer (2001), to repeat the self-titled name of their first release. This
        album quickly became known as \"The Green Album\" due to its distinctive bright
        green coloring. Shortly after the release of the album, Weezer went on another
        American tour. They attracted a new generation of fans thanks to heavy MTV
        rotation for the videos of their hit singles \"Hash Pipe\" and \"Island in
        the Sun\". \nAs reported on August 16, 2001, by MTV, bassist Mikey Welsh was
        checked into a psychiatric hospital. His whereabouts were previously unknown,
        as he mysteriously went missing before the filming of the second video for
        \"Island in the Sun\". Weezer was prompted to find a temporary replacement
        for Welsh. Through a mutual friend, Cuomo received Scott Shriner''s number
        and asked if he was interested in filling in for Welsh. Shriner accepted the
        invitation. \n\nMaladroit (2002-2003)edit:\n\nMain article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maladroit\nThe
        band took an experimental approach for the recording process of their fourth
        album by allowing fans to download demos from their official website in return
        for feedback. After the release of the album, the band said that this process
        was something of a failure, as the fans did not supply them with coherent,
        constructive advice. Cuomo eventually delegated song selection for the album
        to the band''s original A&R rep, Todd Sullivan, saying that Weezer fans chose
        the \"wackest songs.\" Only the song \"Slob\" was included on the album due
        to general fan advice. \nThe recording was also done without input from Weezer''s
        record label, Interscope. Cuomo had what he then described as a \"massive
        falling out\" with the label. In early 2002, well before the official release
        of the album, the label sent out a letter to radio stations requesting the
        song be pulled until an official, sanctioned single was released. Interscope
        also briefly shut down Weezer''s audio/video download webpage, removing all
        the MP3 demos. Online Weezer fans staged a brief protest, with several websites
        proclaiming \"Free Maladroit\". \nIn April 2002, former bassist Matt Sharp
        sued the band, alleging, among several accusations, that he was owed money
        for cowriting several Weezer songs. The suit was later settled out of court.
        \nThe fourth album, Maladroit, was released on May 14, 2002, only one year
        after its predecessor. The album served as a harder-edged version of the band''s
        trademark catchy pop-influenced music, and was replete with busy 1980s-style
        guitar solos. Although met with generally positive critical reviews, its sales
        were not as strong as those for \"The Green Album\". Two singles were released
        from the album. The music video for \"Dope Nose\" featured an obscure Japanese
        motorcycle gang, and was put into regular rotation. The music video for \"Keep
        Fishin''\" combined Weezer with The Muppets, and had heavy rotation on MTV.
        Both videos were directed by Marcos Siega. \nAs soon as Maladroit had wrapped
        up, the band immediately began work on their fifth album, recording numerous
        demos between tours (often recording as many as 24 songs in a day). These
        songs were eventually scrapped, and Weezer took a break after the release
        of two albums in quick succession. During this break, Bell and Wilson released
        LPs from their respective side projects Space Twins and The Special Goodness.
        \nWeezer released their much-delayed first DVD on March 23, 2004. The Video
        Capture Device DVD chronicles the band from its beginnings through Maladroit''s
        Enlightenment Tour. Compiled by Karl Koch, the DVD features home video footage,
        music videos, commercials, rehearsals, concert performances, television performances,
        and band commentary. The DVD was certified \"gold\" on November 8, 2004. \n\nMake
        Believe (2003-2006)edit:\n\nMain article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_Believe_(Weezer_album)\nFrom
        December 2003 to the fall of 2004, the members of Weezer recorded a large
        amount of material intended for a new album to be released in the spring of
        2005 with producer Rick Rubin. The band''s early recording efforts became
        available to the public through the band''s website. The demos were a big
        hit, but none of the songs recorded at this time were included on the finished
        album. That album, titled Make Believe, was released on May 10, 2005. Despite
        commercial success, Make Believe got a mixed reception from critics, receiving
        an average score of 52 on review collator Metacritic. Although some reviews,
        such as AMG''s, compared it favorably to Pinkerton, others, among them Pitchfork
        Media''s score of 0.4 out of 10, panned the album as predictable and lyrically
        poor. \nThe album''s first single, \"Beverly Hills\", became a hit in the
        U.S. and worldwide, staying on the charts for several months after its release.
        It became the first Weezer song to hit No. 1 on the Billboard Modern Rock
        chart. \"Beverly Hills\" was nominated for Best Rock Song at the 48th Annual
        Grammy Awards, the first ever Grammy nomination for the band. The video was
        also nominated for Best Rock Video at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards. The
        second single off Make Believe was \"We Are All on Drugs\". MTV refused to
        play the song, so Weezer re-recorded the lyrics by replacing \"on drugs\"
        with \"in love\" and renaming the song \"We Are All in Love\". In early 2006,
        it was announced that Make Believe was certified platinum, and \"Beverly Hills\"
        was the second most popular song download on iTunes for 2005, finishing just
        behind \"Hollaback Girl\" by Gwen Stefani.Make Believe''s third single, \"Perfect
        Situation\", spent four weeks in a row at number one on the Billboard Modern
        Rock chart. \"This Is Such a Pity\" was the band''s fourth single from the
        album, but no music video was made for its release. The Make Believe tour
        also found the band using additional instruments onstage, adding piano, synthesizers,
        pseudophones, and guitarist Bobby Schneck. \nThe band has announced the possible
        release of a live DVD composed of footage from the 2005 Japan tour. It will
        consist of a two-day, seven-camera shoot of the shows in Japan, plus material
        that will be drawn from various behind-the-scenes footage. The DVD was announced
        in late 2005, but in a 2006 update on the band''s Web site, Karl Koch noted
        it was \"apparently edited, but has been put on hold for now.\" \n\nThe Red
        Album (2007-2008)edit:\n\nMain article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weezer_(2008_album)\nWeezer
        (also referred to as \"The Red Album\") was released in June 2008. Rick Rubin
        produced the album and Rich Costey mixed it. The record was described as \"experimental\",
        and according to Cuomo, included longer and non-traditional songs, TR-808
        drum machines, synthesizers, Southern rap, baroque counterpoint, and band
        members other than Cuomo writing, singing, and switching instruments. Pat
        Wilson said the album cost about a million dollars to make, contrasting it
        with the $150,000 budget of \"The Blue Album\". The album''s singles were
        produced by Jacknife Lee. Its lead single, \"Pork and Beans\", topped the
        Billboard Modern Rock Tracks charts for 11 weeks, and its music video won
        a Grammy for Best Short Form Music Video. The second single, \"Troublemaker\",
        debuted at No. 39 on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart and peaked
        at No. 2. In October 2008, the group announced that the third single would
        be \"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)\". \nOn
        May 30, 2008, the Toledo Free Press revealed in an interview with Scott Shriner
        that Weezer would be unveiling the \"Hootenanny Tour\", in which fans would
        be invited to bring their own instruments to play along with the band. Said
        Shriner: \"They can bring whatever they want... oboes, keyboards, drums, violins,
        and play the songs with us as opposed to us performing for them.\" \nThe band
        performed five dates in Japan at the beginning of September and then embarked
        on what was dubbed the ''Troublemaker'' tour, consisting of 21 dates around
        North America, including two in Canada. Angels and Airwaves and Tokyo Police
        Club joined them as support at each show, and Brian Bell''s ''other'' band
        The Relationship also performed at a handful of dates. Shortly before the
        encore at each show, the band would bring on fans with various instruments
        and perform Island in the Sun and Beverly Hills with them. At a show in Austin,
        after Tokyo Police Club had played their set, Rivers was wheeled out in a
        box and mimed to a recording of rare Weezer demo, ''My Brain'', dressed in
        pajamas and with puppets on his hands, before being wheeled off again. This
        bizarre event later surfaced as the climax to a promo video for Cuomo''s second
        demo album, Alone 2. \nCuomo also wrote a song with pop duo Aly & AJ, and
        was very pleased with the way the girls worked. It is unknown if the song
        will be made public on an album. \nOn December 4, iOS developer Tapulous released
        the game Christmas With Weezer, featuring gameplay similar to Tap Tap Revenge
        and six Christmas carols performed by the band. A digital EP featuring the
        songs, titled \"Christmas with Weezer\", was also released on December 16,
        2008. \n\nRaditude (2009-2010)edit:\n\nMain article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raditude\nWeezer
        toured with Blink-182 in 2009, including an August 30 stop at the Virgin Festival
        at Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Maryland. Drummer Josh Freese joined
        Weezer on a temporary basis to play drums on the tour, while Pat Wilson switched
        to guitar. Wilson said in an interview for Yahoo! Music that Cuomo wanted
        \"to be active and more free on stage and him having guitar on was an impediment.\"
        Freese stated he was a Weezer fan and did not want to pass up the opportunity
        to play with them. \nRaditude''s album artwork was revealed on September 11,
        featuring a National Geographic contest-winning photograph of a jumping dog
        named Sidney. The record''s release was pushed to November 3, 2009, where
        it debuted as the seventh best-selling album of the week on the Billboard
        200 chart. The band scheduled tour dates in December 2009 extending into early
        2010 to coincide with the new album''s release. On December 6, 2009, Cuomo
        was injured when his tour bus crashed in upstate New York due to black ice.
        Cuomo suffered three broken ribs, and his assistant broke two ribs. His wife,
        baby daughter, and their nanny were also on the bus, but they escaped injury.
        Weezer cancelled tour dates the following day. The band resumed touring on
        January 20, 2010. \nIn December 2009, it was revealed that the band was no
        longer with Geffen Records. The band stated that they would still release
        new material, but they were unsure of the means, whether it be self-released,
        released online, or getting signed by another label. Eventually, the band
        was signed to the independent label Epitaph. \nThe band also recorded a cover
        of \"I''m a Believer\" for the movie Shrek Forever After. \nWeezer co-headlined
        The Bamboozle in May, 2010, and performed at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival
        in Manchester, Tennessee in June. In August, 2010, Weezer performed at the
        Reading and Leeds Festival, and performed at the Voodoo Experience festival
        in New Orleans, LA in October 2010. \nOn June 11, 2010, the band released
        a new single, \"Represent\". The song was said to be an \"unofficial US anthem\"
        to coincide with the 2010 FIFA World Cup. \n\nHurley, Death to False Metal
        and Mikey Welsh''s death (2010-present)edit:\n\nThe album Hurley was released
        in September 2010 through Epitaph Records. The name comes from the character
        Hugo \"Hurley\" Reyes from the television show Lost. Jorge Garcia, the actor
        who portrayed Hurley, stated that being featured on the album cover is \"one
        of the biggest honors of his career.\"  Weezer used internet streaming service
        YouTube as a way to promote the album. Weezer loaned itself to 15 amateur
        online video producers, \"going along with whatever plans the creator could
        execute in about 30 minutes.\" They have used many of the popular channels
        to promote themselves, such as Barely Political, Ray William Johnson and Fred
        Figglehorn. The Gregory Brothers solicited musical and vocal contributions
        from the band on one of its compositions built around speeches by Rep. Charles
        Rangel and President Barack Obama. Weezer calls the promotion \"The YouTube
        Invasion\". \nIn November 2010, Weezer released a compilation album composed
        of re-recorded versions of unused recordings spanning various years, Death
        to False Metal. On the same day a deluxe version of Pinkerton, which includes
        \"25 demos, outtakes and live tracks\" was also released. A third volume of
        Rivers Cuomo''s solo Alone series, titled Alone III: The Pinkerton Years,
        consisting of demos and outtakes from the Pinkerton sessions, was released
        on December 12, 2011. They also contributed a cover of The Cars'' \"You Might
        Think\" for the Disney-Pixar film Cars 2. \nOn February 12, 2011, Weezer performed
        a live set for \"Guitar Center Sessions\" on DirecTV. The episode included
        an interview with Weezer by program host, Nic Harcourt. \nOn October 8, 2011
        former bassist Mikey Welsh was found dead in a Chicago, Illinois hotel room.
        Weezer performed in Chicago the very next day, and dedicated the concert to
        Welsh (Welsh was supposed to be a surprise guest at that concert). \nThe band
        began working on their tenth studio album in September 2010 with the intent
        of a 2011 release, but the year ended without seeing a release. The band headlined
        a four-day rock-themed Carnival Cruise from Miami to Cozumel that set sail
        on January 19, 2012. \nIn May 2012, drummer Patrick Wilson released his fourth
        studio album with side-project, The Special Goodness, entitled Natural. \nIn
        July 2012, Weezer headlined the inaugural Bunbury Music Festival in Cincinnati,
        Ohio. Also, in July they announced plans for an Australian tour in early 2013,
        their first since 1996. \nOn December 25, 2012, according to official Weezer
        website, assistant Karl Koch stated Weezer is looking to record another album,
        but had no official information yet. He wrote, \"While its impossible to say
        when the next Weezer album will come out, rest assured the band is excited
        and united in their desire to make it great.\" \n\nMusical style and influencesedit:\n\nWhile
        Weezer are most commonly an alternative rock and power pop band, they have
        also been associated with other genres, such as pop punk,emo and indie rock.
        \nMany modern bands, such as Real Estate,Dinosaur Pile-Up,Cymbals Eat Guitars
        and The Fall of Troy, list Weezer as an influence. Weezer themselves have
        listed several influences, among them KISS (with direct references in the
        song \"In the Garage\"), Nirvana (who were their labelmates at DGC for a very
        brief time before Kurt Cobain''s death), The Beach Boys, Pixies (especially
        early in their career), Sonic Youth, Oasis, and Wax. Early Weezer demos, such
        as \"Paperface\", have obvious musical ties to the Pixies and Nirvana. Also,
        the song \"Susanne\" originally contained the lyrics, \"Even Kurt Cobain and
        Axl Rose\", before being changed to \"Even Izzy, Slash, and Axl Rose\" after
        Cobain''s death. There is also a direct reference to Nevermind in \"Heart
        Songs\", a track found on The Red Album. As a side project, Weezer briefly
        played Nirvana and Oasis covers under the stage moniker \"Goat Punishment\".
        In 1998, Weezer covered \"Velouria\" by the Pixies for a tribute album, and
        in 2005 briefly got to tour with their idols for a few dates. Green Day has
        also been said to be an influence (there is a lyric about them in \"El Scorcho\"),
        and it has been acknowledged that the two bands are friends and enjoy each
        other''s music. Weezer contributed the song \"Worry Rock\" to A Different
        Shade of Green: Tribute to Green Day. Cuomo also covered \"Brain Stew\" in
        a 2009 AOL Sessions set. \n\nSolo workedit:\n\nRivers Cuomo released a demo-compilation
        album titled Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo on December 18, 2007.
        The album contains demos of Cuomo''s that span from 1992 to 2007, including
        songs from Weezer''s abandoned second album, Songs from the Black Hole. \nBrian
        Bell has been working on a solo project called The Relationship, and did not
        write any songs for Raditude in order to save material for his solo work.
        He has also collaborated with Space Twins. \nCuomo''s second demo album, Alone
        II: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo, was released on November 25, 2008.
        The album includes further tracks from Songs from the Black Hole, early versions
        of songs later released as full-band demos, and other demo tracks. \nAlso,
        Mikey Welsh played with Juliana Hatfield, The Kickovers, Heretix, Jocobono,
        Slower and Left Nut; Patrick Wilson records with The Special Goodness; and
        Matt Sharp is in The Rentals and performs alone under his own name. \n\nBand
